1.	User CRUD Operations:
	•	Create: Functionality to add new users to the database.
	•	Read: Retrieve user information from the database, such as fetching user details by ID.
	•	Update: Modify existing user data (e.g., updating the email or password).
	•	Delete: Remove a user from the database.
	2.	Implement Redis for Caching:
	•	Caching User Data: Store frequently accessed user data (like profile information) in Redis to reduce database load and improve response times.
	•	Reduce Database Queries: By caching, the system can retrieve data from Redis instead of querying the database every time.
	•	Time-to-Live (TTL): Set expiration times for cached data to ensure that updates or deletions in the database reflect in the cache after a certain period
